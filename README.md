## Classification Projects
1. [Diabetes Classification](https://github.com/faizollah/diabetes_classification): A machine learning project focused on classifying diabetes outcomes based on various health metrics.
2. [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/faizollah/traffic-sign-classifier): A classifier trained to recognize traffic signs from the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

## Regression Projects
1. [UK Grid Modeling](https://github.com/faizollah/UK-Grid-Modeling): This project aims to predict the actual carbon intensity of the UK National Grid using forecasted values.
2. [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/faizollah/predict-car-price): a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, fuel type, and more.

## Deep Learning Projects
1. [Uber Fare Prediction](https://github.com/faizollah/uber-fare-prediction): This project aims to predict Uber fares based on various features using a deep neural network. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, and hyperparameters were tuned using Keras Tuner.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects
1. [Vehicle Type Recognition](https://github.com/faizollah/vehicle-type-recognition): This project explored various techniques to recognize vehicle types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including pre-trained model and transfer learning.
