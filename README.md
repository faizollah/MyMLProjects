## Classification Projects
1. [Diabetes Classification](https://github.com/faizollah/diabetes_classification): A machine learning project focused on classifying diabetes outcomes based on various health metrics.
2. [Traffic Sign Classification](https://github.com/faizollah/traffic-sign-classifier): A classifier trained to recognize traffic signs from the GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark dataset.

## Regression Projects
1. [UK Grid Modeling](https://github.com/faizollah/UK-Grid-Modeling): This project aims to predict the actual carbon intensity of the UK National Grid using forecasted values.
2. [Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/faizollah/predict-car-price): a machine learning model that predicts car prices based on various features such as the car's age, mileage, fuel type, and more.

## Deep Learning Projects
1. [Uber Fare Prediction](https://github.com/faizollah/uber-fare-prediction): This project aims to predict Uber fares based on various features using a deep neural network. The model was built using TensorFlow and Keras, and hyperparameters were tuned using Keras Tuner.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) Projects
1. [Vehicle Type Recognition](https://github.com/faizollah/vehicle-type-recognition): This project explored various techniques to recognize vehicle types using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), including pre-trained model and transfer learning.
2. [Skin Lesion Classification](https://github.com/faizollah/skin-lesion-classification): This project aims to classify skin lesions using various deep learning models including custom CNN, transfer learning, and ensemble transfer learning. The dataset used is the HAM10000 dataset from Kaggle.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Time Series Analysis
1. [Jena Climate Temperature Prediction](https://github.com/faizollah/Jena-Climate-Temperature-Prediction): A machine learning project that utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks to predict temperatures based on historical climate data from the Jena Climate dataset.

## Natural Language Processing (NLP) Projects
1. [Emotion Analysis with BERT and DistilBert](https://github.com/faizollah/Emotion-Analysis-with-BERT-and-DistilBert): This repository contains code for fine-tuning pre-trained BERT and DistilBert models for emotion analysis on a Twitter dataset.
